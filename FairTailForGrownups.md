### How to overcome impatience more easily
I would like to know how can I overcome this most easily, because otherwise I experience a lot of impatience.
我想知道我如何能最輕鬆地度過這疫情隔離期？因為否則我會體驗到許多的不耐煩、沒耐心。

Thank you so much, goodbye.
非常感謝你，再見。

Again remember impatience come from the belief that you need patience

and believing 'you need patience' comes from the idea that you are supposed to be somewhere better than you are


Be in the moment.There is nothing more important than what happening in the moment

Use it fully and you wont need to be patient waiting for something else to happen

And if you are not waiting for something to happen,you wont be impatient

its that simple

You are creating an insistence ,you are creating an expectation that there's something more important you should be focus on other than whats happening in your life at any given moment

And there isn't anything more important than what's happening in the moment

When you know that ,you wont need patience,and you wont be impatient
